# Accessible Slider

Accessible Slider is an easy to set up, fully customizable carousel slider.

This module integrates [Paypal's Accessiblity Plugin](https://paypal.github.io/bootstrap-accessibility-plugin/), along with [Jon Gunderson's Tabpanel A11y Plugin](http://jongund.github.io/aria-examples/bootstrap-carousel/carousel-3.html). The primary module sets up a new view option that will create a slider view block or page. Since it's a view, you can set any content type to be a slider, and order/filter the view however you want. If you create a view block, you can then use Drupal's block page to set where you'd like it to display. Also included is an example plugin that will create a content type, populate slide content, create a view, and create a block.
